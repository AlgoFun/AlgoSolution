input: standard
output: standard


It is well known that three segments can make a triangle if and only if the sum of lengths of any two of them is strictly greater than the length of the third one. Professor Vasechkin has segments. He asked you, if you could find at least one set of three segments among them which can be used by professor to make a triangle.

Input
The first line of the input contains the only integer number (). The following lines contain the length of segments professor has. The length of any segment is the integer number from 1 to .

Output
Write to the output the length of segments requested by the professor â€” three numbers delimited by spaces. Write three zeros if there are no such three segments.
