Once upon a time Professor Idioticideasinventor was travelling by train. Watching cheerless landscape outside the window, he decided to invent the theme of his new scientific work. All of a sudden a brilliant idea struck him: to develop an effective algorithm finding an integer number, which is times less than the sum of all its integer positive predecessors, where number is given. As far as he has no computer in the train, you have to solve this difficult problem.
